# slot-nik

slot-nik is a web component that provides ShadowDOM [slot-like](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-nik) features, when used in conjunction with something like [sceadu-f√¶x](https://github.com/bahrus/sceadu-fax).

For now, it is simply an extension of the esoterically-named web component [xt-f](https://github.com/bahrus/xt-f).  As functionality evolves, that may change.
